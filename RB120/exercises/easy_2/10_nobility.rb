Nobility

Now that we have a Walkable module, we are given a new challenge. Apparently 
some of our users are nobility, and the regular way of walking simply isn't 
good enough. Nobility need to strut.

We need a new class Noble that shows the title and name when walk is called:

We must have access to both name and title because they are needed for other purposes that we aren't showing here.
