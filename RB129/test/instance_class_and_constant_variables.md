# Instance variables, class variables, and constants, including the scope of each type and how inheritance can affect that scope

Instance variables are defined starting with a `@` symbol. Instance variables are scoped to the object level, meaning it can be referenced from anywhere

This should tell you that instance variables are scoped at the object (or instance) level, and are how objects keep track of their states.
